> Example
set logging file ~/dpvs.log
set logging on
set trace-commands on
show logging

set logging on
Enable logging.

set logging off
Disable logging.

set logging file file
Change the name of the current logfile. The default logfile is gdb.txt.

set logging overwrite [on|off]
By default, GDB will append to the logfile. Set overwrite if you want set logging on to overwrite the logfile instead.

set logging redirect [on|off]
By default, GDB output will go to both the terminal and the logfile. Set redirect if you want output to go only to the log file.
