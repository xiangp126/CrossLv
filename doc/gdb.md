### compile source file for debugging

_compile source file for debugging_

- `-g3` must be assigned
- `-Onum` must all be removed (~~Shift + o, optimized for short~~)
- or change all `-O1`, `-O2`, ... etc to `-O0`

```bash
g++ -Wall -g3 main.cpp -o main
```

<a id=run></a>
### run
> run with arguments after launching `gdb`

```bash
cgdb main
(cgdb) run arg1 arg2 ...
```

<a id=finish></a>
### finish
> **continue until hit a return**<br>
Upon return, the value returned is printed and put in the value history.

<a id=break></a>
### break
```bash
break main
break <Line_Number>

# break at a line of certain file
break /Full/path/to/service.cpp:45
```

<a id=until></a>
### until
> Execute until the program reaches a source line **greater than** the current or a specified location (same args as break command) within the current frame

```bash
until + 3
until <Line_Number>
```

<a id=condition></a>
### condition
> Specify breakpoint number `N` to break only if `COND` is true<br>
> `N` is an **integer**<br>
> `COND` is an **expression** to be evaluated whenever breakpoint `N` is reached

```bash
condition N COND
```

<a id=info></a>
### info

`Arg` can be:

> `LINENUM`, to list around that line in current file<br>
`FILE:LINENUM`, to list around that line in that file<br>
`FUNCTION`, to list around beginning of that function<br>
`FILE:FUNCTION`, to distinguish among like-named static functions<br>
Default is to describe the last source line that was listed<br>

```bash
# Core addresses of the code for a source line
info linke <Arg>
```

<a id=logging></a>
### logging
> You may want to save the output of GDB commands to a file. There are several commands to control GDBâ€™s logging.

_logging - Example_

```vim
(gdb) set logging file ~/dpvs.log
(gdb) set logging on
(gdb) set trace-commands on
(gdb) show logging

(gdb) set logging on
Enable logging.

(gdb) set logging off
Disable logging.

(gdb) set logging file file
Change the name of the current logfile. The default logfile is gdb.txt.

(gdb) set logging overwrite [on|off]
By default, GDB will append to the logfile. Set overwrite if you want set logging on to overwrite the logfile instead.

(gdb) set logging redirect [on|off]
By default, GDB output will go to both the terminal and the logfile. Set redirect if you want output to go only to the log file.

(gdb) show logging
Show the current values of the logging settings.
```

<a id=reverse-next></a>
### reverse-next
> step program backward, proceeding through subroutine calls
<https://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/ProcessRecord>
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7517236/how-do-i-enable-reverse-debugging-on-a-multi-threaded-program>

> for **multi-thread reverse debugging**
You need to active the **instruction-recording target**, by executing the command `record`

_reverse - Example_

```
(gdb) record
(gdb) next
(gdb) reverse-next

...

(gdb) record stop
```

<a id=horizontal></a>
### horizontal or vertical
> Jump to cgdb **source window**, like VIM, type command below to switch to horizontal split

`Alt + <Up/Down>` to jump into and scroll `source window`

```bash
set winsplitorientation=vertical
set winsplitorientation=horizontal
```

<a id=shortcut></a>
### shortcut key
> only support cgdb >= **v0.7.0**, refer <http://cgdb.github.io/docs/cgdb.html>

```bash
# When you are in the source window, you are implicitly in CGDB mode.
# All of the below commands are available during this mode.

# Puts the user into GDB mode.
i

# Puts the user into scroll mode in the GDB mode.
s

# Opens a new tty for the debugged program.
Ctrl-T
```
