### view-source - If right-clicking is disabled on a web page

If right-clicking is disabled on a web page, there are still a few alternative methods you can try to view the page source:

1. Keyboard shortcuts: You can try using keyboard shortcuts to access the page source. Pressing Ctrl+U (or **Command+Option+U on Mac**) usually opens the page source in a new tab or window, depending on the browser.

2. URL modification: Another option is to modify the URL of the web page to directly access the page source. Type "view-source:" (without quotes) before the URL in the address bar of your browser and press Enter. For example, **"view-source:https://www.example.com"** would display the page source of the example.com website.

3. Developer Tools: Most modern web browsers have built-in developer tools that allow you to view the page source and inspect elements. You can access these tools by pressing **F12** or right-clicking on the page (if right-click is enabled) and selecting "Inspect" or "Inspect Element." Once the developer tools are open, you can navigate to the "Elements" or "Sources" tab to view the page source.

It's worth noting that some websites may have additional measures in place to prevent users from easily accessing or copying their source code. However, these methods should work for most web pages that have disabled the right-click function.
